Photos are compressed and decompressed with ~2.5% loss. Must be of type PPM.

Architecture:
    - For compression, we begin by reading in the image and then 
      converting the RGB pixels in 2x2 blocks to a
      binary bit word using the bit pack interface. This is 
      done using discrete cosine transformation. We write the 
      bit word for each block in row-major output to the disk.

    - For decompression, we unpack the bit words using the same bit pack 
      interface, perform the inverse conversion to get back the RGB pixels, 
      and then create a PPM image for output.
