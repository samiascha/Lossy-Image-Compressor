We believe that the assignment has been correctly implemented. Photos are 
compressed and decompressed with minimal loss.

Architecture:
    - For compression, we begin by reading in a PPM image, and then 
      converting the RGB pixels of each 2x2 block in the PPM into a
      binary bit word using the bit pack interface. We write the 
      bit word for each block in row-major output to the disk.

    - For decompression, we unpack the bit words using the same bit pack 
      interface, perform the inverse conversion to get back the RGB pixels, 
      and then create a PPM image for output.
